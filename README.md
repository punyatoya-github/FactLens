# **DocChat**

## **📄 Overview**

DocChat is a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that extracts precise, verifiable answers from long, complex documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD). It uses document-aware parsing (Docling), a hybrid retriever (BM25 \+ vector search), and a LangGraph multi-agent workflow (relevance check → research → verification → self-correct) to produce source-backed, hallucination-resistant answers optimized for tables, figures, scanned pages, and dense text.

## **✨ Features**

* **Hybrid retrieval**: BM25 lexical search combined with Chroma vector search for robust passage selection  
* **Accurate parsing**: Docling converts files to structured Markdown and extracts tables; supports OCR for scanned PDFs  
* **Multi-agent workflow**:  
  * **Relevance Checker** to detect in-scope vs out-of-scope queries  
  * **Research Agent** to synthesize draft answers from retrieved context  
  * **Verification Agent** to validate answers and produce a structured verification report  
  * **Self-correction loop** to re-run research when unsupported claims or contradictions are detected  
* **Persistent vector store**: ChromaDB for fast similarity search and session reuse  
* **Web UI**: Gradio interface for uploading docs, entering questions, and viewing verification reports  
* **Examples**: Preloaded documents and sample queries for quick demos

## **🧰 Tech Stack**

* **Language**: Python 3.11  
* **Document parsing**: Docling (Markdown extraction, table handling, OCR)  
* **Workflow orchestration**: LangGraph  
* **RAG glue**: LangChain-style patterns; BM25 retriever; ChromaDB vector store  
* **Embeddings & models**: IBM watsonX AI (embeddings \+ inference for research and verification agents)  
* **Frontend**: Gradio

## **🚀 Installation**

1. Clone and checkout the release branch:

   * git clone \--no-checkout https://github.com/punyatoya-github/DocChat.git docchat  
   * cd docchat  
   * git checkout 2-final  
2. Create and activate a Python 3.11 virtual environment:

   * python3.11 \-m venv venv  
   * source venv/bin/activate  
3. Install dependencies:

   * pip install \-r requirements.txt

Notes:

* Accepted file formats: **.pdf**, **.docx**, **.txt**, **.md**  
* Do not commit credentials; keep them in environment variables or a local .env (provide .env.example if needed)

## **▶️ Usage**

1. Start the Gradio app:

   * python app.py  
2. Open the application. From the UI you can:

   * Upload one or more documents  
   * Enter natural-language questions about uploaded files  
   * Load provided example datasets and queries  
   * View the generated answer and the verification report  
3. Key runtime behavior:

   * Docling parses uploads into structured Markdown and chunks them for retrieval  
   * Hybrid retriever (BM25 \+ Chroma vector search) is built and cached per session using SHA-256 file hashing  
   * LangGraph orchestrates relevance → research → verify → self-correct  
   * Final answer and verification report are displayed in the UI

Tips:

* If you edit uploaded documents, the system will detect changes and rebuild the retriever automatically  
* Stop the server with Ctrl+C

## **✅ Testing the application**

* Unit and integration test targets:  
  * DocumentProcessor: structured Markdown & table extraction; OCR for scanned PDFs  
  * RetrieverBuilder: BM25 and vector top-k correctness and weighting behavior  
  * LangGraph workflow: CAN\_ANSWER / PARTIAL / NO\_MATCH routing and self-correction loops  
  * VerificationAgent: structured verification output parsing (Supported, Unsupported Claims, Contradictions, Relevant)  
* Manual test checklist:  
  * Load an example document and submit an in-scope question; confirm Supported: YES  
  * Submit an out-of-scope question; confirm NO\_MATCH and no hallucinated answer  
  * Alter a source passage, re-run the query, and observe unsupported claim detection or self-correction  
* Performance considerations:  
  * Measure BM25 vs vector latencies and tune HYBRID\_RETRIEVER\_WEIGHTS  
  * Monitor model inference times; large models may require timeouts, retries, or smaller alternatives
